# Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning for Image Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning to classify images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The tasks include:
- Data preparation and preprocessing.
- Customizing a pre-trained model with additional classifier layers.
- Training and fine-tuning the model.
- Evaluating its performance and comparing it with previous models (ANN and CNN).

## Objectives
- Utilize transfer learning to leverage pre-trained feature extractors.
- Fine-tune the model to improve performance on a custom dataset.
- Optimize the model for test accuracy and F1-score.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: [Specify the dataset, e.g., Tiny ImageNet, or another complex dataset].
- Number of Classes: [Specify].
- Total Images: [Specify].

## Pre-trained Model
- Model: [e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, or MobileNetV2].
- Features frozen: [Specify the layers frozen during training].
- Custom layers added: Fully connected layers for classification.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Normalized pixel values to the range of 0â€“1.
  - Created training, validation, and testing splits.
- **Model Customization**:
  - Added a custom classifier on top of the pre-trained model.
  - Experimented with hyperparameters for optimization.
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Generated learning curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
